            <h2>Data Structure</h2> 
            <p>
                Data structures are basically just that - they are structures which can hold some data together.
                In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data.
            </p>  
            <p>
                There are four built-in data structures in Python - list, tuple, dictionary and set. 
                We will see how to use each of them and how they make life easier for us.
            </p>
            <h3>List</h3>
            <p>
                A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list. 
                This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you have a list of items to buy, 
                except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list whereas in Python you put commas in between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. 
                Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. 
                Since we can add and remove items, 
                we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# This is my shopping list
shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']

print('I have', len(shoplist), 'items to purchase.')

print('These items are:', end=' ')
for item in shoplist:
    print(item, end=' ')

print('\nI also have to buy rice.')
shoplist.append('rice')
print('My shopping list is now', shoplist)

print('I will sort my list now')
shoplist.sort()
print('Sorted shopping list is', shoplist)

print('The first item I will buy is', shoplist[0])
olditem = shoplist[0]
del shoplist[0]
print('I bought the', olditem)
print('My shopping list is now', shoplist)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
I have 4 items to purchase.
These items are: apple mango carrot banana 
I also have to buy rice.
My shopping list is now ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana', 'rice']
I will sort my list now
Sorted shopping list is ['apple', 'banana', 'carrot', 'mango', 'rice']
The first item I will buy is apple
I bought the apple
My shopping list is now ['banana', 'carrot', 'mango', 'rice']
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Tuple</h3>
            <p>
                A Python tuple is a collection type data structure which is immutable by design and holds a sequence of heterogeneous elements.
                It functions almost like a Python list but with the following distinctions.
                Tuples store a fixed set of elements and don’t allow changes whereas the list has the provision to update its content.
                The list uses square brackets for opening and closing whereas, and a tuple has got parentheses for the enclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can create a tuple by placing a sequence of desired elements separated using commas inside a pair of round brackets (), i.e., parentheses.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# create an empty tuple
py_tuple = ()
print("A blank tuple:", py_tuple)

# create a tuple without using round brackets
py_tuple = 33, 55, 77
print("A tuple set without parenthesis:", py_tuple, "type:", type(py_tuple))

# create a tuple of numbers
py_tuple = (33, 55, 77)
print("A tuple of numbers:", py_tuple)

# create a tuple of mixed numbers
# such as integer, float, imaginary
py_tuple = (33, 3.3, 3+3j)
print("A tuple of mixed numbers:", py_tuple)

# create a tuple of mixed data types
# such as numbers, strings, lists
py_tuple = (33, "33", [3, 3])
print("A tuple of mixed data types:", py_tuple)

# i.e. a nested tuple
py_tuple = (('x', 'y', 'z'), ('X', 'Y', 'Z'))
print("A tuple of tuples:", py_tuple)

            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">

A tuple of tuples: (('x', 'y', 'z'), ('X', 'Y', 'Z'))
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Set</h3>
            <p>
                A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).
                However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.
                Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma, or by using the built-in set() function.
                It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.). But a set cannot have mutable elements like lists,
                sets or dictionaries as its elements.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# set cannot have duplicates
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
print(my_set)

# we can make set from a list
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2])
print(my_set)

# set cannot have mutable items
# here [3, 4] is a mutable list
# this will cause an error.

my_set = {1, 2, [3, 4]}
# initialize a with {}
a = {}

# check data type of a
print(type(a))

# initialize a with set()
a = set()

# check data type of a
print(type(a))
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>

            </pre>
            <h3>Dictionary</h3>
            <p>
                Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, 
                which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.
                Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. 
                Dictionary holds a pair of values, 
                one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. 
                Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
