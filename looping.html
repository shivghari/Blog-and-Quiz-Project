            <p>Looping Concept in Python</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "blog-content">

            <h2>What is Loop?</h2>
            <p>
                In computer science, a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of 
                instructions until a specific condition is met. 
                Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Loops are supported by all modern programming languages, though their implementations and syntax may differ. 
                Two of the most common types of loops are the while loop and the for loop.
            </p>
            <h3>for Loop</h3>
            <p>
                The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. 
                Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
            </p>

            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
for val in sequence:
    Body of for
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Here, val is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration.
                Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence. 
                The body of for loop is separated from the rest of the code using indentation.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list

# List of numbers
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]

# variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
    sum = sum+val

print("The sum is", sum)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
The sum is 48
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The range() function
            </p>
            <p>
                We can generate a sequence of numbers using range() function. 
                range(10) will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers).
                We can also define the start, stop and step size as range(start, stop,step_size). 
                step_size defaults to 1 if not provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can use the range() function in for loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers. 
                It can be combined with the len() function to iterate through a sequence using indexing. Here is an example.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# Program to iterate through a list using indexing

genre = ['pop', 'rock', 'jazz']
                    
# iterate over the list using index

for i in range(len(genre)):
    print("I like", genre[i])
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content"> 
                <code>
I like pop
I like rock
â€‹I like jazz
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>while Loop</h3>
            <p>
                The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
                We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>Syntax :</p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
while test_expression:
    Body of while
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the while loop, test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. 
                After one iteration, the test expression is checked again. 
                This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
# Program to add natural
# numbers up to 
# sum = 1+2+3+...+n

# To take input from the user,
# n = int(input("Enter n: "))

n = 10

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

# print the sum
print("The sum is", sum)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
Enter n: 10
The sum is 55
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the above program, the test expression will be True as long as our counter variable i is 
                less than or equal to n (10 in our program).
                We need to increase the value of the counter variable in the body of the loop. This is very important (and mostly forgotten). 
                Failing to do so will result in an infinite loop (never-ending loop).
            </p>
            <p>while loop with else :</p>
            <p>
                The else part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to False.
                The while loop can be terminated with a break statement. 
                In such cases, the else part is ignored. Hence, a while loop's else part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
'''Example to illustrate
the use of else statement
with the while loop'''

counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print("Inside loop")
    counter = counter + 1
else:
    print("Inside else")
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre class="code-content">
                <code>
Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside else
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Here, we use a counter variable to print the string Inside loop three times.
                On the fourth iteration, the condition in while becomes False. Hence, the else part is executed.
